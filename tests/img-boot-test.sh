# img-boot-test.sh — LIGHT boot smoke test for the installed disk image.
# Boots the raw .img in qemu (UEFI via OVMF, virtio disk) and verifies the
# ASSEMBLED image reaches a usable system: loader -> kernel -> launchd PID 1
# -> getty login -> root shell on a UFS root.
#
# It deliberately does NOT run the deep functional suite
# (/usr/tests/freebsd-launchd-mach/run.sh — the LEAF command-suite + launchd /
# CoreFoundation / launchctl + syslog + network-daemon gates). Those exercise
# the Darwin userland and belong in nextbsd-userland's ci-image-boot, closest
# to the source; re-running them here (on the same pkg-built rootfs the ISO
# shares) was redundant and the syslog/network round-trips race under qemu. The
# ISO builder only needs to prove the two boot PATHS reach a shell: this
# direct-UFS disk image and the live ISO (iso-boot-test.sh).
#
# Success = "login:" prompt reached (launchd PID 1 got getty up).
#
# Arch-agnostic: the qemu shape (binary, machine, UEFI firmware, NIC, accel)
# comes from tests/qemu-arch.sh, which takes ARCH from the environment or infers
# it from the NextBSD-<arch>-<date> image name. amd64 boots on q35+OVMF, arm64 on
# virt+AAVMF.
