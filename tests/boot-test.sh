# Stage 1a: capture getty's boot banner. PAM port iter 4 (issue #99)
# restored RunAtLoad on com.apple.hostnamed.plist so hostnamed runs
# at boot. Banner format: "<ostype>/<arch> (HOSTNAME) (console)", from getty's
# \s/\m -- ostype is NextBSD after the kernel rebrand (FreeBSD upstream) and
# arch follows the target (amd64/arm64/powerpc/...). Matched brand- AND
# arch-agnostically so neither a rebrand nor a new arch breaks this check.
#
# This check is INFORMATIONAL, not gating. Both daemons (hostnamed
# + getty) have RunAtLoad=true and launchd dispatches them in
# parallel; getty's fork+exec+banner-print path (~10-30ms) finishes
# before hostnamed's fork+exec+synthesize+sethostname path
# (~30-100ms — kenv + SMBIOS + getifaddrs + crypt). The first-boot
# banner consistently loses the race and shows 'Amnesiac'.
#
# What's actually working: kern.hostname IS set to the synthesized
# value before login runs (verified by HOSTNAMED-OK and PAM-LOGIN-OK
# downstream); second-getty-respawn (after logout) shows the
# synthesized name. The banner-at-first-boot is purely cosmetic.
#
# Apple's macOS doesn't hit this because loginwindow reads the
# hostname dynamically; FreeBSD getty captures it at print time.
# Proper fix needs either launchd job ordering (no native mechanism)
# or a getty patch to defer banner until kern.hostname stabilizes —
# both out of scope for the PAM port.
