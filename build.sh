# build.sh — assemble bootable NextBSD images by INSTALLING the packages.
#
# The entire OS now comes from the nextbsd-pkg flat repo: one `pkg install
# NextBSD-everything` lays down the freebsd-compat base + kernel + Darwin
# userland (incl. the LaunchDaemons, bundled into the NextBSD-userland package)
# + kexts. The user-editable /etc config (accounts, sshd_config, pam.d, ttys,
# ...) is NOT package-owned — it is seeded from the nextbsd-overlays repo below
# so `pkg upgrade` can never clobber it. There is NO in-chroot compile — src/ is
# gone — and no tar-extract/hand-drop of base/kernel/kexts.
#
# Runs inside a FreeBSD 15.1 VM (vmactions) — a REAL FreeBSD host, so pkg(8) is
# native and installs FreeBSD:15 packages with no ABI/OSVERSION hackery. The
# per-arch lanes (amd64, aarch64) run as independent parallel jobs.
#
# Everything is host-driven (pkg -r, pwd_mkdb -d, cap_mkdb <target>) rather than
# chroot'd, so the aarch64 image assembles in the same x86 VM without qemu-user
# (the NextBSD-* packages ship no exec'ing post-install scripts; makefs/mkuzip/
# mkimg are arch-agnostic).
#
# Produces:
#   out/NextBSD-<arch>-<date>.img.zip   GPT disk image (BIOS+UEFI, rw UFS root)
#   out/NextBSD-<arch>-<date>.iso.zip   live ISO (mfsroot -> uzip -> vfs.pivot)
#
# BOARD=rpi500 instead produces one artifact and no ISO:
#   out/NextBSD-rpi500-<arch>-<date>.img.zip   MBR: FAT32 boot + rw UFS root
# The board token comes FIRST and that is load-bearing -- build.yml's release
# step does IMG=$(ls out/NextBSD-${ARCH}-*.img.zip) into a scalar, so an
# arch-first name would match two files and break the existing arm64 lane.

# 5b. Drop pkg's build residue before makefs bakes the tree in. Two separate
#     things accumulate in the rootfs, and neither is needed at runtime:
#
#       - the downloaded package tarballs, in PKG_CACHEDIR (/var/cache/pkg).
#         Every install above (NextBSD-everything, then pkglist.txt) leaves its
#         .pkg files there. `pkg clean -a` is scoped to exactly this.
#       - the fetched repository catalogues, in PKG_DBDIR
#         (/var/db/pkg/repos/<repo>/db), written by the `pkg update` calls.
#         `pkg clean` does NOT touch these and there is no pkg subcommand that
#         does, so they have to go by hand.
#
#     Both of those are the pkg-visible paths; on disk they live under
#     private/var, since step 3 made /var a relative symlink -> private/var.
#     `pkg -r` walks that symlink (only a *trailing* symlink wouldn't be
#     followed), so the clean below resolves to private/var/cache/pkg; the rm
#     names private/ explicitly, as the rest of this script does.
#
#     Both regenerate on the installed system: pkg redownloads a tarball when
#     asked to install, and refetches a catalogue on any install/fetch/search
#     (REPO_AUTOUPDATE defaults to YES) or an explicit `pkg update`.
#     The catalogues are not small — on gershwin-on-freebsd the upstream
#     `latest` catalogue grew 71 MiB -> 1.66 GiB, shipped twice, which added
#     3.3 GiB to the staged tree and ~446 MiB to the compressed image, and the
#     bloated /var then OOM'd that project's boot test.
#     Runs before ALL THREE consumers: the rw disk image (step 6), the compact
#     rootfs.uzip (step 7), and the mfsroot.
#     KEEP: /usr/local/etc/pkg/repos — the repo *config* written in step 5, which
#     the shipped system needs so `pkg install` works out of the box — and
#     private/var/db/pkg/local.sqlite, the installed-package registry.
#     Host-driven via `pkg -r`, matching the rest of this script (no chroot).

# 6b-rpi. Raspberry Pi 500+ boot partition + MBR image   (BOARD=rpi500)
#
#   The BCM2712 bootloader lives in EEPROM and boots what the plan calls route
#   (a): it reads config.txt off the first FAT partition, loads the DTB named
#   there, patches it (memory size, MAC, the RP1 window), loads kernel8.img and
#   enters it at EL2 with x0 = the FDT physical address. No loader(8), no UEFI.
#   That is why this lane produces an .img and no .iso: the firmware looks for
#   a FAT partition holding config.txt, and an ISO 9660 image has neither, so
#   it is never even opened. Booting NextBSD from optical media on this board
#   is not a missing feature, it is not a thing the hardware does.
#
#   It also means nothing can be kldload'ed at boot -- there is no loader to do
#   it -- so every boot-critical driver is compiled into the board kernel.
#
#   None of bootcode.bin / start*.elf / fixup*.dat belong here. Those are the
#   pre-2712 VideoCore boot chain; Raspberry Pi OS ships them only because one
#   boot partition serves every model back to the Pi 2. Measured on the board:
#   a 2712 boot partition needs exactly config.txt, a DTB, and the kernel.
#
#   The root half needs nothing from this partition at all. The board kernel
#   carries ROOTDEVNAME="ufs:/dev/ufs/ROOTFS" and INIT_PATH=/sbin/launchd
#   compiled in (nextbsd-kernel#11 / #180), so it mounts root by GEOM label and
#   execs launchd with no tunables passed from anywhere. The MBR slice layout

# The EEPROM bootloader reads this file, loads device_tree=, patches it, loads
# kernel= and enters it at EL2 with x0 = the FDT physical address. There is no
# loader(8) anywhere in that path, so anything the kernel needs in order to
# boot is compiled into it rather than loaded here.
kernel=kernel8.img
cmdline=cmdline.txt
arm_64bit=1

# Deliberately NO device_tree= line. The firmware selects the right blob for
# the board it is running on, from the ones shipped alongside this file --
# which is what lets one image serve the whole Pi 5 family. Pinning it here
# would hand every board but one a device tree for hardware it is not.

# The kernel's console is UART10 inside the BCM2712 at 0x10_7d00_1000 -- the
# 3-pin JST-SH debug header on the board, not the 40-pin GPIO header. Which
# UART that is gets decided by a compiled-in hw.uart.console, not by this file.
# enable_uart=1 is still required: it pins the VPU core clock, and without it
# the divisor moves with clock scaling and the console degrades to line noise
# partway through boot.
enable_uart=1

# Video. Without these the firmware sets up no display and allocates no
# framebuffer, vt(4) comes up as "init without driver", and the machine boots
# to a black screen -- which on this board is indistinguishable from a kernel
# that never started.
#
# max_framebuffers is what makes the firmware allocate one at all.
# display_auto_detect lets it probe and configure whatever is attached.
#
# hdmi_force_hotplug is the interesting one, and it is here deliberately.
# Measured on a Pi 500+: the firmware reported "hotplug 0" with a monitor
# attached and its EDID perfectly readable -- DDC works (pins 15/16), hotplug
# detect (pin 19) does not, which is what a micro-HDMI adapter that skips that
# pin looks like. Raspberry Pi OS has the same workaround in its own
# cmdline.txt as the "D" in video=HDMI-A-1:1280x720@60D, so the fault is
# common enough that their default image carries a fix for it.
#
# The cost is a few MB of framebuffer allocated on a headless machine. The
# alternative failure is a black screen with no message, on hardware whose
# only other console is a cable inside the case. Worth the trade here; it is
# also the first thing to remove if a display misbehaves.
max_framebuffers=2
display_auto_detect=1
hdmi_force_hotplug=1

# framebuffer_depth is deliberately NOT set here any more (nextbsd#429 follow-up).
#
# It was here because the console runs on the firmware framebuffer: left unset
# the firmware allocates 16bpp, bcm2835_fbd(4) asks it for 24, and the console
# comes up with a blue cast and text so dim it is nearly unreadable:
#
#   changing fb bpp from 16 to 24
#   fb0: 1920x1080(1920x1080@0,0) 24bpp     <- wrong, unreadable
#   keeping existing fb bpp of 32
#   fb0: 1920x1080(1920x1080@0,0) 32bpp     <- correct
#
# 24bpp is three bytes per pixel with no padding; a driver writing 32-bit
# pixels into it lands a byte out of alignment on every pixel, which smears
# the colour channels.
#
# The intent is that KMS owns the display instead, now that VideoCoreKMS
# autoloads (nextbsd-kernel-extensions#185) -- at which point the firmware's
# choice of depth stops mattering because nothing is drawing into its
# framebuffer.
#
# UNVERIFIED ON HARDWARE. The Pi was unreachable when this was written, so the
# console has not been looked at without this line. The evidence that it may
# still be needed:
#
#   - the firmware allocates the console framebuffer before any kext can load,
#     so autoload does not change what happens at boot
#   - KMS does not take over the console. Measured with KMS loaded and
#     /dev/dri/card0 present, the console was still on the firmware fb:
#         fb0: <BCM2835 VT framebuffer driver> on simplebus0
#         VT: initialize with new VT driver "fb"      <- "fb", not "drmfb"
#     because no fbdev emulation is wired up (drm_fbdev_dma_setup is a stub).
#   - nextbsd#425, "scfb segfaults on a 16bpp framebuffer (works at 32bpp)",
#     is open.
#
# If the console comes up dim, blue-cast or blank on a Pi 5 after this change,
# this line is why, and restoring it is the fix. The real precondition is fbdev
# emulation so vt(4) moves onto drmfb.

# Deliberately NO hardcoded resolution. Forcing hdmi_group/hdmi_mode or
# framebuffer_width/height WAS measured to be ignored -- the firmware read
# EDID and chose 1920x1080 over the 720p asked for, which is the better
# answer and the one that works on someone else's monitor. Note that depth
# above is the exception: do not generalise "the framebuffer_* settings are
# ignored" from width and height, which is a mistake already made once.

# No VENDOR dtoverlay= or dtparam= lines. Every overlay in the vendor tree is
# written against Linux driver bindings; NextBSD reads the same device tree
# with its own drivers, and an overlay that renames or reparents a node moves
# it out from under the FreeBSD driver's compatible string. Add them one at a
# time, each with a boot that proves it.
#
# nextbsd-fkms is deliberately NOT enabled. It brings up the firmware-KMS node,
# which VideoCoreKMS.kext binds -- and firmware KMS cannot program a plane on
# 2712, because the firmware does not service SET_PLANE
# (nextbsd-kernel-extensions#48, measured). No planes means no hardware cursor.
#
# VideoCore6KMS.kext drives the same display directly and does not need that
# node. The two must never both be loaded, since they drive the same hardware,
# so leaving the node disabled removes the way to get that wrong.
#
# Verified on a Pi 500+ with this overlay disabled: VideoCore6KMS binds, EDID
# reads over the firmware mailbox, the connector reports the attached panel by
# name, and a modeset at its native 2560x1440@60 puts an image on screen with
# no errors.
#
# The overlay file still ships, so re-enabling it is a one-line change for
# anyone who wants to compare the two drivers.

# nextbsd-v3d enables v3d@2000000, which also ships disabled. Measured on a Pi
# 500+: the node comes up with the "disabled" gone and IRQs 70/71 resolved, and
# enabling it disturbs neither the firmware framebuffer nor firmware KMS -- fb0
# still comes up and vc4_fkms0 still attaches with /dev/dri/card0.
#
# It does NOT by itself give you 3D. Nothing in tree binds "brcm,2712-v3d", so
# /dev/dri stays card0 with no renderD128. GL additionally needs a v3d DRM
# driver, the drm_gpu_scheduler it depends on, and mesa-libs built with vc4 and
# v3d in GALLIUM_DRIVERS (nextbsd#427). Enabled now because the node has to be
# up before any of that can be developed against it.
dtoverlay=nextbsd-v3d

# nextbsd-vc4-kms enables the seven nodes the full KMS port needs: the vc6
# master, hvs, both pixelvalves, both HDMI controllers and ddc0. Measured on a
# Pi 500+: all seven come up with their IRQs assigned -- HVS with exactly 3
# (ch0/1/2-eof) and each HDMI with exactly 5 -- and firmware KMS still attached
# alongside them.
#
# Enabled, deliberately, even though vc4_kms.ko is not packaged yet: the driver
# is under active development on this hardware
# (nextbsd-kernel-extensions#51) and the nodes have to be enabled for it to
# bind at all. Shipping it disabled would mean hand-editing this file on the
# FAT32 partition after every image rebuild.
#
# It is harmless while nothing binds those nodes. It becomes MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
# with nextbsd-fkms the moment vc4_kms.ko is installed, because both drive the
# same display -- at which point exactly one of vc4_fkms and vc4_kms may be
# loaded. That is a driver/packaging decision, not a device-tree one, and this
# comment is where to start when it has to be made.

CFG

    # FreeBSD's FDT bootargs parser takes the "FreeBSD:" prefix and reads what
    # follows as boot flags. The file ships with none set, so a Pi boots the
    # way every other NextBSD machine does.
    #
    # It used to say "FreeBSD: -v", from when this board was being brought up
    # and its serial log was the only instrument there was. That is no longer
    # the right default, and leaving it was a trap rather than a nicety:
    #
    #   - The rootfs carries nextbsd-overlays' loader.conf.d, so a Pi already
    #     gets boot_mutemsgs="YES" (nextbsd#363). RB_VERBOSE is exactly what
    #     that mute exempts, so a -v that arrived would turn the quiet console
    #     off again on this board alone.
    #   - It does not arrive today. parse_fdt_bootargs() only parses when
    #     fdt_get_chosen_bootargs() succeeds, and a tryboot with exactly that
    #     line produced a boot that was not verbose, so the firmware appears
    #     not to be writing /chosen/bootargs at all (nextbsd-kernel#93). The
    #     flag was therefore inert -- and would have started working, silently
    #     and everywhere, the day that was fixed.
    #
    # The file still ships. It is the first place a human will look to change
    # a boot flag, and `FreeBSD: -v` is one edit away for anyone debugging.
